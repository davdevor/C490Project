# My andriod app Project

## Features
This app is going to let the user store equations as strings. It will then let the user come back to those saved equations and enter in data for the app to solve the equations.

## How to run the project
Clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio. Then just run the project on a virtual device or a device that is connected.
Since I am using Firebase for the user authentication to sign in with google you might have to create a Firebase project for the app to work properly.
